# Active Context: @nazruden/clickup-server

## 1. Current Focus

- Finalizing Memory Bank updates after implementing Space and Folder tools.
- Preparing for integration testing of new tools and addressing MCP Inspector stdio parsing issues.

## 2. Recent Changes & Activities

- **Implemented Space Management Tools:**
  - Added types to `src/types.ts` (`ClickUpSpace`, `GetSpacesParams`, etc.).
  - Added service methods to `src/services/clickup.service.ts` (`getSpaces`, `createSpace`, `getSpace`, `updateSpace`, `deleteSpace`).
  - Defined tools and handlers in `src/index.ts` (`clickup_get_spaces`, etc.).
  - Added unit tests to `src/__tests__/services/clickup.service.test.ts`.
- **Implemented Folder Management Tools:**
  - Added types to `src/types.ts` (`ClickUpFolder`, `GetFoldersParams`, etc.).
  - Added service methods to `src/services/clickup.service.ts` (`getFolders`, `createFolder`, `getFolder`, `updateFolder`, `deleteFolder`).
  - Defined tools and handlers in `src/index.ts` (`clickup_get_folders`, etc.).
  - Added unit tests to `src/__tests__/services/clickup.service.test.ts`.
- Updated `README.md` with documentation for new Space and Folder tools.
- Updated `progress.md` to reflect these changes.
- Previous: Pivoted auth to Personal API Token, refactored relevant files, unit tested initial tools, removed OAuth.

## 3. Next Steps (Short-Term)

- **Integration Testing:** Perform end-to-end testing of all new Space and Folder tools using MCP Inspector.
- **Address MCP Inspector stdio JSON parsing errors:** Investigate and resolve issues where server logs (e.g., from `logger.debug` or `ts-node-dev`) might be interfering with MCP message parsing in stdio mode. This is critical for reliable testing with MCP Inspector.
- **Create `.aijournal**:\*\* Document key learnings from this development cycle (e.g., MCP stdio logging considerations, PowerShell env var syntax if re-encountered, detailed ClickUp API v2 endpoint usage for Spaces/Folders).
- **Create `.cursor/rules**:\*\* If specific, reusable error patterns or architectural decisions solidify, document them as rules.
- **Clarify Python Files:** Minor task to confirm role of `setup.py` and other Python-related files.
- **Refine Configuration (Optional):** Consider removing `ENCRYPTION_KEY` logic from `src/config/app.config.ts` and `src/security.ts` as it's unused.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- All new tools use Personal API Token and target ClickUp API v2.
- Stdio communication is primary.
- Unit tests for `ClickUpService` use `axios` mocks.
- **Critical Issue:** Non-MCP output (logs) on stdout is likely breaking MCP Inspector parsing. This needs to be the immediate focus for testing and potentially for how the dev server (`npm run dev`) is configured or how logging is handled in stdio mode.

## 5. Open Questions & Blockers

- **Blocker:** MCP Inspector stdio parsing errors due to server logs on stdout. This hinders further interactive testing.
- Minor: Confirm role of Python files.

## Confidence Score: N/A

**Reasoning:** Tracks ongoing work and highlights a critical blocker for testing.
