## Active Context

**Last Updated:** $(date --iso-8601=seconds)

**Current Focus:**
Finalizing unit test corrections for Doc and View tools after ClickUp API v3 updates and MCP server output standardization. All tests are now passing.

**Recent Changes:**

- **Doc Service (`doc.service.ts`) & Tests (`doc.service.test.ts`):**
  - `getDocPages`: Updated to full v3 API logic (endpoint, `workspace_id` validation, error handling).
  - Tests: All error message expectations aligned with actual service behavior. All `doc.service.test.ts` tests are passing.
- **View Tool Handlers (`view.tools.ts`) & Tests (`view.tools.test.ts`):**
  - Standardized output format for all data-returning handlers to: `Summary Message. Details: JSON_DATA`.
  - `handleUpdateView`: Corrected service call to pass the single `params` object.
  - `handleDeleteView`: Standardized success message to "View successfully deleted.".
  - `handleGetViewTasks`: Added input validation for the `page` parameter. Ensured correct parsing of `serviceResponse.tasks`.
  - Tests: All summary message expectations, error messages, and mock call assertions in `view.tools.test.ts` aligned with updated handler logic. All `view.tools.test.ts` tests are passing.
- **Overall:** All 97 unit tests across 7 test suites are now passing.

**Next Steps:**
Awaiting further instructions from the user. The codebase related to Doc and View tools, including their tests, is now stable and verified.

## 1. Current Focus

- Updating Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) after successful v3 migration and testing of all Document tools.
- Finalizing `.aijournal` and `.cursor/rules` entries related to API investigation and schema design.
- Preparing to resume unit tests for View tool handlers (`src/__tests__/tools/view.tools.test.ts`).

## 2. Recent Changes & Activities

- **Document Tools - v3 API Migration & Testing (Completed):**

  - **`clickup_search_docs`**: Migrated to `GET /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs`. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_create_doc`**: Migrated to `POST /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs`. Resolved issues with incorrect `workspace_id` and ensured `workspaceId` path parameter is a number. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_get_doc_pages`**: Remains on v2 endpoint (`GET /doc/{doc_id}/page`) but functions correctly with doc IDs obtained from v3 `searchDocs` or `createDoc`. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_create_doc_page`**: Migrated to `POST /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs/{docId}/pages`. Updated params and service logic. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_get_doc_page_content`**: Migrated to `GET /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs/{docId}/pages/{pageId}`. Updated params and service logic. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_edit_doc_page_content`**: Migrated to `PUT /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs/{docId}/pages/{pageId}`. Updated params and service logic. Successfully tested.
  - All related `src/types.ts`, `src/services/resources/doc.service.ts`, and `src/tools/doc.tools.ts` files were updated accordingly.
  - **Key Learnings Captured:** Importance of validating resource IDs (like `workspace_id`) and ensuring correct data types for path parameters (string vs. number).

- **API Investigation Rule & Journal Entry:**

  - Created `.cursor/rules/api-investigation.mdc` (after some difficulty with file creation, resolved via workaround).
  - Created `.aijournal` entry detailing the API investigation methodology and learnings from the `createDoc` troubleshooting.

- **Tool Schema Compatibility Debugging (for `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`):**

  - Investigated "incompatible argument schema" errors reported by the Gemini model for several tools.
  - Affected tools included `clickup_create_task`, `clickup_update_task` (due to shared `taskSchema`), and `clickup_set_task_custom_field_value`.
  - Employed an iterative debugging approach:
    - Stripped down `createTaskTool` schema to minimal required fields (`list_id`, `name`).
    - Systematically reintroduced fields one by one (`description`, `assignees`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, `time_estimate`, `tags`) to pinpoint the incompatible definition.
  - **Key Findings & Resolutions:**
    - **Numeric Enums:** The `enum: [1, 2, 3, 4]` for the `priority` field (type `number`) in `taskSchema` was identified as the primary culprit for `createTaskTool` and `updateTaskTool`.
      - **Solution:** Removed the numeric `enum`. The `type: "number"` was retained, and the `description` was enhanced to explicitly state the valid numeric inputs (1, 2, 3, 4) and their meanings. This pattern was confirmed to resolve the incompatibility.
    - **`type: "any"`:** The `value: { type: "any" }` in `setTaskCustomFieldValueTool` was problematic.
      - **Initial Fix Attempt:** Changed to `type: ["string", "number", "boolean", "array"]`. This was still incompatible.
      - **Successful Solution:** Changed `value` to `type: "string"`. The `description` was extensively updated to instruct the LLM on how to format various underlying data types (numbers, booleans, arrays, specific date formats based on `value_options.time`) into this single string type. This requires the handler function to parse the string back into the appropriate type for the ClickUp service.
    - **Loose Object Properties:** For `
