## Active Context

**Last Updated:** $(date --iso-8601=seconds)

**Current Focus:**
Concluding current development cycle by updating memory bank and README.md after recent tool testing and removal of unsupported `deleteDocTool`.

**Recent Changes:**

- **Doc Tooling (`doc.tools.ts`, `doc.service.ts`, `index.ts`, `types.ts`):**
  - Investigated persistent "405 Method Not Allowed" errors for `clickup_delete_doc` tool when targeting ClickUp API v3 `/workspaces/{workspace_id}/docs/{doc_id}` endpoint with `DELETE` method.
  - Confirmed via ClickUp API documentation that a direct `DELETE` operation for individual docs at this V3 endpoint is not listed as a supported operation.
  - Removed `deleteDocTool`, its handler `handleDeleteDoc`, the service method `DocService.deleteDoc`, and the `DeleteDocParams` type from the codebase.
- **API URL Configuration:**
  - Standardized `clickUpApiUrl` in `src/config/app.config.ts` to `https://api.clickup.com`.
  - Ensured all service calls in `*.service.ts` files explicitly prepend either `/api/v2/` or `/api/v3/` to their paths for clarity and correct URL construction.
- **Live Testing:** Conducted several rounds of live testing, creating and deleting Spaces, Folders, Lists, Tasks, Views, and Docs (and Doc Pages), which helped identify and resolve the URL construction issues and the `deleteDoc` API limitation.

**Next Steps:**
User has indicated that the next major step will be expanding Task features, but this will be for a future session. Current session is concluding with documentation updates.

## 1. Current Focus

- Updating Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, etc.) and `README.md`.

## 2. Recent Changes & Activities

- **`deleteDocTool` Removal:**

  - Investigated "405 Method Not Allowed" for `DELETE /api/v3/workspaces/.../docs/...`.
  - Confirmed via API documentation that this specific V3 endpoint and method for deleting docs is not supported.
  - Removed `deleteDocTool` from `doc.tools.ts`.
  - Removed `handleDeleteDoc` from `doc.tools.ts`.
  - Removed `DocService.deleteDoc` method from `doc.service.ts`.
  - Removed `DeleteDocParams` from `types.ts`.
  - Removed `deleteDocTool` from `serverOptions.capabilities.tools` in `index.ts`.
  - Removed `deleteDocTool` import from `index.ts`.
  - Ensured no handler case for `clickup_delete_doc` exists in `index.ts` switch statement or `toolHandlers` map.

- **URL Path Standardization & Testing:**

  - Updated `app.config.ts` to use `clickUpApiUrl: "https://api.clickup.com"`.
  - Verified and corrected paths in `doc.service.ts` (for V3 calls) and `list.service.ts` (for V2 calls), and older direct calls in `clickup.service.ts` to explicitly include `/api/v2/` or `/api/v3/` prefixes.
  - Successfully tested `create_list` and other tools after these fixes.

- **Doc Service (`doc.service.ts`) & Tests (`doc.service.test.ts`):**
  - `getDocPages`: Updated to full v3 API logic (endpoint, `workspace_id` validation, error handling).
  - Tests: All error message expectations aligned with actual service behavior. All `doc.service.test.ts` tests are passing.
- **View Tool Handlers (`view.tools.ts`) & Tests (`view.tools.test.ts`):**
  - Standardized output format for all data-returning handlers to: `Summary Message. Details: JSON_DATA`.
  - `handleUpdateView`: Corrected service call to pass the single `params` object.
  - `handleDeleteView`: Standardized success message to "View successfully deleted.".
  - `handleGetViewTasks`: Added input validation for the `page` parameter. Ensured correct parsing of `serviceResponse.tasks`.
  - Tests: All summary message expectations, error messages, and mock call assertions in `view.tools.test.ts` aligned with updated handler logic. All `view.tools.test.ts` tests are passing.
- **Overall:** All 97 unit tests across 7 test suites are now passing.

**Next Steps:**
Awaiting further instructions from the user. The codebase related to Doc and View tools, including their tests, is now stable and verified.

## 1. Current Focus

- Updating Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) after successful v3 migration and testing of all Document tools.
- Finalizing `.aijournal` and `.cursor/rules` entries related to API investigation and schema design.
- Preparing to resume unit tests for View tool handlers (`src/__tests__/tools/view.tools.test.ts`).

## 2. Recent Changes & Activities

- **Document Tools - v3 API Migration & Testing (Completed):**

  - **`clickup_search_docs`**: Migrated to `GET /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs`. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_create_doc`**: Migrated to `POST /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs`. Resolved issues with incorrect `workspace_id` and ensured `workspaceId` path parameter is a number. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_get_doc_pages`**: Remains on v2 endpoint (`GET /doc/{doc_id}/page`) but functions correctly with doc IDs obtained from v3 `searchDocs` or `createDoc`. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_create_doc_page`**: Migrated to `POST /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs/{docId}/pages`. Updated params and service logic. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_get_doc_page_content`**: Migrated to `GET /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs/{docId}/pages/{pageId}`. Updated params and service logic. Successfully tested.
  - **`clickup_edit_doc_page_content`**: Migrated to `PUT /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs/{docId}/pages/{pageId}`. Updated params and service logic. Successfully tested.
  - All related `src/types.ts`, `src/services/resources/doc.service.ts`, and `src/tools/doc.tools.ts` files were updated accordingly.
  - **Key Learnings Captured:** Importance of validating resource IDs (like `workspace_id`) and ensuring correct data types for path parameters (string vs. number).

- **API Investigation Rule & Journal Entry:**

  - Created `.cursor/rules/api-investigation.mdc` (after some difficulty with file creation, resolved via workaround).
  - Created `.aijournal` entry detailing the API investigation methodology and learnings from the `createDoc` troubleshooting.

- **Tool Schema Compatibility Debugging (for `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`):**

  - Investigated "incompatible argument schema" errors reported by the Gemini model for several tools.
  - Affected tools included `clickup_create_task`, `clickup_update_task` (due to shared `taskSchema`), and `clickup_set_task_custom_field_value`.
  - Employed an iterative debugging approach:
    - Stripped down `createTaskTool` schema to minimal required fields (`list_id`, `name`).
    - Systematically reintroduced fields one by one (`description`, `
