## Insight: Investigating ClickUp API Endpoints with OpenAPI Specification & Data Validation

**Context:** Encountered persistent 404 errors when attempting to use the `clickup_create_doc` tool. The initial endpoint `/api/v2/space/{space_id}/doc` failed. A subsequent attempt with a presumed v3 endpoint `/api/v3/workspaces/{workspace_id}/docs` also failed, even after aligning the request with an OpenAPI specification.

**Problem:** Difficulty in identifying the correct API path, parameters, request body structure, and ensuring the validity of data (like `workspace_id`) for creating documents in ClickUp, especially with the transition from v2 to v3.

**Methodology for Resolution:**

1.  **Obtain API Specification:** Leveraged a provided OpenAPI JSON file (`docs/673cf4cfdca96a0019533cad.json`).
2.  **Format Specification:** Formatted the single-line JSON for effective analysis.
3.  **Targeted Search (`grep_search`):** Used `operationId` (e.g., `"createDoc"`) and tags (e.g., `"tags": ["Docs"]`) to locate the API definition.
4.  **Detailed Spec Analysis:**
    *   Identified the v3 path: `POST /v3/workspaces/{workspaceId}/docs`.
    *   Noted path parameter `workspaceId` was `type: "number"`.
    *   Examined `requestBody` for required (`name`) and optional fields.
5.  **Iterative Implementation & Testing:**
    *   **Update Types (`src/types.ts`):** Aligned `CreateDocParams`.
    *   **Update Service (`src/services/resources/doc.service.ts`):** Used correct v3 endpoint, request body, and crucially, converted string `workspace_id` to a number for the path.
    *   **Update Tool Definition (`src/tools/doc.tools.ts`):** Aligned `inputSchema`.
    *   **Rebuild & Test:** Rebuilt MCP server and re-tested after changes.
6.  **Data Validation (Critical Step):** When 404s persisted despite spec alignment, the validity of the `workspace_id` itself was questioned. A call to `clickup_get_teams` (to get current workspaces) revealed the previously used `workspace_id` was incorrect. Using the correct, validated `workspace_id` resolved the final 404.

**Outcome:** This systematic approach, combining meticulous API spec alignment with proactive data validation (especially for resource identifiers), enabled the successful creation of a document. The final fix involved both using the correct `workspace_id` AND ensuring it was passed as a number in the API path.

**Learning:**
    *   When an API specification is available, it's the primary source of truth for request structure.
    *   Careful, iterative alignment of client code with the spec is essential.
    *   **Crucially, always validate resource identifiers (like `workspace_id`, `list_id`, etc.) being used in API calls, especially if they are sourced from previous operations or configurations. They might become stale or incorrect.**
    *   Pay close attention to data types required by the API, particularly for path parameters (e.g., string vs. number).
